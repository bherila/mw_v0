      ISELIN, NEW JERSEY, (April 28, 2004) Middlesex Water Company, (NASDAQ: 
      MSEX), a provider of water and wastewater services in New Jersey and 
      Delaware, announced a 6.0% increase in consolidated operating revenues for 
      the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. <br>
      First Quarter 2004 Results<br>
      Revenues for the first quarter totaled $15.9 million, up from $15.0 
      million for the same period in 2003. Double-digit increases in base rates 
      and customer growth for its Delaware subsidiary, Tidewater Utilities, 
      Inc., (TUI), generated an additional $0.4 million in revenues during the 
      quarter, while our meter installation joint venture added $0.5 million to 
      revenues. Operating expenses increased to $13.6 million up from $12.6 
      million. Costs associated with the customer growth in Delaware and the 
      meter installation joint venture amounted to $0.7 million of the increase. 
      Higher purchased water costs, energy costs and business insurance costs 
      for the Middlesex system accounted for $0.3 million of the operating 
      expenses.<br>
      The Company reported Common Stock earnings of $0.9 million, or $0.09 per 
      share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, compared with $1.1 
      million or $0.11 per share in 2003. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Twelve Month Earnings</b><br>
      For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, revenues were $65.0 million, 
      up from $62.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Double-digit 
      increases in base rates and customer growth for TUI generated $1.7 million 
      of additional revenues. Revenues from our meter installation joint venture 
      and other non-regulated activities pushed revenues up by $1.0 million. 
      Cool, wet weather conditions caused revenues to fall by $0.5 in our 
      Middlesex system. In addition to cost increases in the same operating 
      expenses categories as the quarter, water treatment costs, employee costs 
      and corporate governance compliance costs also increased. Interest expense 
      rose as the amount of long-term borrowings rose by almost $10.0 million. 
      As a result, net income decreased to $6.4 million from $7.7 million for 
      the period ended March 31, 2004. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Board Declares Quarterly Dividend</b><br>
      The Board of Directors of Middlesex Water Company declared a quarterly 
      dividend of $0.165 per share on the Common Stock, payable on June 1, 2004, 
      to stockholders of record as of May 14, 2004. The Company has paid cash 
      dividends in varying amounts continually since 1912 and the dividend has 
      been increased in each <br>
      year since 1973. Middlesex Water has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan under 
      which dividends and optional cash payments can be used to purchase 
      additional shares of Common stock. The Company also offers direct deposit 
      of dividends whereby dividend payments may be deposited into shareholders’ 
      checking, savings or money market accounts. <br>

    – <i>April 26, 2004 – </i>Tidewater Utilities, Inc. (Tidewater)<i> </i>has 
    filed a request with the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) for a 24% 
    increase in water rates.&nbsp; Tidewater has invested $11.9 million in plant 
    upgrades and equipment over the past year to keep pace with double-digit 
    growth in its customer base.&nbsp; The Company, which last filed for an increase 
    in January 2002, is requesting an overall increase of $2.5 million over 
    current revenues, to cover costs of its increased capital investment as well 
    as operations and maintenance expenses. The Company is proposing that new 
    rates be implemented in phases -- with an initial 13% interim rate increase 
    within 60 days of the filing request, -- and the remainder split and phased 
    in over two subsequent 6-month periods.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000066">
<font size="2">Presently, the average household served by Tidewater is charged 
approximately $29.35 per month for 5,000 gallons of water.&nbsp; This figure includes 
the 4.89% Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) which was approved by 
the PSC and placed into effect on January 1, 2004.&nbsp; The new rate, based on 5,000 
gallons of water, and reflecting the final phase of this request, would result 
in a monthly bill of $36.42.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000066">
<font size="2">Since 1992, Tidewater has invested more than $48 million to build 
new water systems, upgrade treatment facilities and improve its water 
distribution infrastructure.&nbsp; In 2003, Tidewater added 31 miles of main and 
installed new wells, pump houses, generators and booster stations throughout its 
systems.&nbsp; The Company continues to focus on creating system interconnections, 
water main extensions and consolidating its many independent systems into 
regional districts. Tidewater operates 70 independent water systems with 100 
water plants and over 209 wells to serve over 240 residential communities 
throughout Delaware.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<font size="2">Tidewater Utilities, Inc., currently serves about 24,000 
residential and other customers in Kent, New Castle and Sussex Counties, DE.&nbsp;

    Middlesex Water Company plans to invest $3.8 million in 2004 to enhance 
    water quality and improve water flows in the Fords section of Woodbridge, 
    the Bonhamtown section of Edison, and other areas within its service area 
    this spring, when it begins its RENEW Program, a rehabilitative effort to 
    clean and line unlined water mains. </font></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial">
    <font size="2" color="#000066">The RENEW Program involves cleaning the 
    accumulated scale from older sections of cast iron pipe and installing a new 
    lining. The project essentially helps to extend the life of older pipe and 
    helps to improve overall water quality and service while strengthening the 
    water distribution infrastructure. Approximately 7 miles of water main will 
    be rehabilitated beginning in early April. This work will affect individual 
    streets in the project area for a period of 2-3 months.</font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial">
    <font size="2" color="#000066">In Fords, water mains under streets within 
    the area north of King Georges Post Road and Amboy Avenue, south of the New 
    Jersey Turnpike, and west of the Garden State Parkway will be rehabilitated. 
    Work will also be performed on mains on streets on South Main Street between 
    Martin Avenue and Woodbridge Avenue in Bonhamtown.<br>
    To provide continual water service, Middlesex Water will erect a temporary 
    water system including hydrants and water service connections aboveground 
    and maintain this system while the mains are being cleaned and lined. 
    Aboveground piping will be visible along the curbs on both sides of the 
    street. </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial">
    <font size="2" color="#000066">“Each year, through the RENEW Program, we are 
    reinvesting in our water infrastructure to help us to better maintain the 
    integrity of our distribution system and deliver water to our customers more 
    effectively,” said Ronald F. Williams, Chief Operating Officer. “Since we 
    initiated the RENEW Program, 51 miles of water mains have been 
    rehabilitated. Throughout our 730-mile Middlesex system, less than 19% of 
    our water mains remain unlined. We intend to continue this program into the 
    future and are being aided this year by low interest loans obtained through 
    the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Trust,” said Mr. Williams.
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial">
    <font size="2" color="#000066">The RENEW Program should not interfere with 
    the delivery of water. Customers can expect to receive continuous water 
    service, except for the few minutes when service is being transferred to and 
    from temporary lines, or when maintenance on the temporary line is required.</font></span></p>

    speak with a RENEW program representative. </font></span></p>

        quarter ended June 30, 2003, were $16.0 million, up $.5 million, from 
        $15.5 million for the same period in 2002. The revenue increase of 3.04% 
        is due to higher base rates and customer growth in Delaware. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">Net income fell by $0.1 million as increases in labor and benefits, water 
        treatment expenses and debt service costs offset the revenue gains. Correspondingly, 
        second quarter 2003 earnings applicable to common stock decreased to $1.7 
        million, or $0.22 per share of common stock, from $1.8 million or $0.24 
        per share for the same period in 2002. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">Six month earnings applicable to common stock were $2.9 million, or $0.37 
        per share of common stock, down $0.03, from $0.40 for the same period 
        in 2002. Labor and benefit cost increases and emergency repair expenses 
        experienced during the severe winter offset the revenue gains during this 
        period. The revenue increase of $1.2 million or 4.12% is due to higher 
        base rates and customer growth in Delaware and increased service fees 
        from contract operations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">Twelve month revenues increased to $62.4 million, up from $61.2 million 
        in 2002, with earnings per share of common stock climbing to $0.95, up 
        $0.03, from $0.92 for the same period in 2002. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">Dennis G. Sullivan, President of Middlesex Water Company stated, &#8220;Our 
        quarterly consolidated results were significantly impacted by unfavorable 
        weather patterns and related consumption decreases. It is likely, however,

      Middlesex Water Company will be working to enhance water quality and 
      improve water flows in Metuchen and the Bonhamtown section of Edison this 
      spring when it begins its RENEW Program, a rehabilitative effort to clean 
      and line cast iron pipe throughout the project area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">The RENEW Program involves cleaning the 
      accumulated scale from older sections of cast iron pipe and installing a 
      new lining. The project essentially helps to extend the life of older pipe 
      and helps to improve overall water quality and service while strengthening 
      the water distribution infrastructure. Approximately 8.5 miles of water 
      main will be rehabilitated beginning in early May. This work will affect 
      individual streets in the Borough for a period of 2-3 months.<br>
      <br>
      In Metuchen, streets south and west of Lake and Middlesex Avenues will be 
      rehabilitated. Additional streets north of Woodbridge Avenue and south of 
      the Amtrak railroad will be rehabilitated in Metuchen. Streets within the 
      area south of Route 1, north of the New Jersey Turnpike, and east South 
      Main Street will be rehabilitated in Bonhamtown. Additional streets west 
      of Route 1 and between Amboy and Grandview Avenues are scheduled for 
      rehabilitation as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">To provide continual water service, 
      Middlesex Water will erect a temporary water system, including hydrants 
      and water service connections, above ground and maintain this system while 
      the mains are being cleaned and lined. Above ground piping will be visible 
      along the curbs on both sides of the street. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">&quot;The RENEW Program, together with year 
      round maintenance activities like hydrant and distribution system 
      flushing, help us to better maintain the integrity of our distribution 
      system and deliver water to our customers more effectively,&quot; said Ronald 
      F. Williams, Vice President of Operations. The project is being funded 
      through low interest loans obtained through the New Jersey Environmental 
      Infrastructure Trust. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000066">The RENEW Program should not interfere with the delivery of water. 
      Customers can expect to receive continuous water service, except for the 
      few minutes when service is being transferred to and from temporary lines, 
      or when maintenance on the temporary line is required.<br>
        Anyone with questions about the RENEW Program or those experiencing 
      extended interruption of service as a result of work being done should 
      call Middlesex Water Company at (732) 634-1500 and ask to speak with a 
      RENEW program representative. </font>

        for the same period in 2002. Double digit increases in Delaware for base 
        rates and customer growth generated the $0.8 million in revenues during 
        the quarter. Record cold winter weather conditions in our New Jersey and 
        Delaware service territories resulted in more main repairs for the quarter, 
        which contributed to significantly higher operating expenses, and offset

      ISELIN, NEW JERSEY, January 30, 2003 - Middlesex Water Company (NASDAQ: 
      MSEX) today reported earnings of $7.5 million, or $.97 per share on a 
      diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $6.7 
      million, or $.88 per share, in 2001. <br>
      <br>
      Company Announces Record Revenues<br>
      Although drought restrictions imposed on our New Jersey services 
      territories resulted in lower consumption, consolidated operating revenues 
      for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 rose to a record $61.9 
      million, up 3.9% over 2001 revenues of $59.6 million. Middlesex was 
      fortunate that approved rate increases implemented in the prior year were 
      in place to offset lost sales due to the drought restrictions. An 8% 
      interim rate increase and a jump in our customer base of 10.3% in Delaware 
      also pushed revenues higher.<br>
      <br>
      Our New Jersey regulated operations expenses were favorably impacted by 
      drought restrictions as water production costs fell 3.3%. This helped to 
      lessen the impact of increased business insurance costs as well as 
      increased Delaware operating costs associated with the customer base 
      increase. Lower interest rates helped to moderate the interest expense 
      increase as the Company continues to finance its significant capital 
      program.<br>
      <br>
      Dividends paid during the year were $0.845 per share compared to $0.83 per 
      share paid in 2001.<br>
      Board Declares Quarterly Dividend<br>
      The Board of Directors of Middlesex Water Company declared a quarterly 
      dividend of $0.215 per share on the Common Stock, payable on February 28, 
      2003, to stockholders of record as of February 14, 2003. The Company has 
      paid cash dividends in varying amounts continually since 1912 and the 
      dividend has been increased in each year since 1973. Middlesex Water has a 
      Dividend Reinvestment Plan under which dividends and optional cash 
      payments can be used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. <br>
      5% Discount to Dividend Reinvestment Plan Participants<br>
      <br>
      For a limited time, the Company is offering up to 150,000 shares of its 
      Common Stock at a 5% discount to participants in its Dividend Reinvestment 
      and Common Stock Purchase Plan. The offer applies to all purchases under

      For An Increase In Rates </b><br>
      <br>
      CONTACT: CONTACT: Gerard L. Esposito, President(302) 376-1501<br>
      <br>
      ODESSA, DELAWARE - January 28, 2003 - Tidewater Utilities, Inc. 
      (Tidewater) has received approval from the Delaware Public Service 
      Commission (PSC) for a 16.4% increase in water rates. Tidewater had filed 
      a petition with the PSC in January 2002 for an overall rate increase of 
      $1.5 million to cover capital improvements needed to meet the needs of its 
      growing customer base. The Company has invested more than $12 million 
      dollars in infrastructure improvements since its last rate filing in 1999. 
      Following a series of public hearings and proceedings, the Commission 
      today approved a 16.4 % increase in rates. The new rate structure is 
      effective on water service rendered on and after February 1, 2003.<br>
      <br>
      Tidewater Utilities, Inc., currently serves over 22,000 residential and 
      other customers in Kent, New Castle and Sussex Counties, DE. Under the new 
      rate structure, water charges for residential customers would consist of a 
      $32.46 quarterly facilities charge and a consumption charge of $3.4342 per 
      1,000 gallons. <br>
      <br>
      Presently, the average household served by Tidewater is charged 
      approximately $25.90 per month for 5,000 gallons of water. This figure 
      includes the interim 8% increase placed into effect on April 1, 2002. The 
      remaining portion of the approved rate increase (8.4%) will become 
      effective February 1, 2003. The new rate, based on 5,000 gallons of water 
      and assuming the remaining percentage granted by the PSC, would result in 
      a monthly bill of $27.99.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The Commission conducted an extensive review of the issues and, although 
      we did not get everything we had requested, overall we acknowledge that 
      the process and decision was a fair one,&quot; said Gerard L. Esposito, 
      President of Tidewater Utilities, Inc. &quot;Moving forward, we will continue 
      to focus on meeting the needs of our customers,&quot; said Esposito.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, Tidewater has installed back-up power generators and iron 
      removal water treatment, built main extensions, established 
      interconnections, constructed plants and storage facilities and hired 
      additional staff to deliver quality service and meet the needs of its 
      customers. <br>
      Tidewater Utilities, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Middlesex Water 
      Company, a leading New Jersey water utility established in 1897. <br>
